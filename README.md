# Purpose
The intent of this project was to improve my knowledge of JavaScript, building a simple-page app. I also had the chance to become more familiar with Git and GitHub.

# Lessons Learned
This is the result of less than a few hours of work on a weekend. I don't plan on returning to work on this project, but it's a neat reminder of where some of my skills were.
